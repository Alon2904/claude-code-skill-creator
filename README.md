# Claude Code Skill Creator

**Interactive `/create-skill` command for Claude Code** - Automate the creation of custom Claude skills with guided workflows, validation, and packaging.

## What Is This?

This tool extends [Anthropic's skill system](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) with an interactive command that automates the entire skill creation process. Instead of manually creating files and following specifications, just run `/create-skill` and let Claude guide you through creating professional, validated skills.

### Key Features

‚ú® **Interactive Creation** - Guided workflow asks questions and customizes everything for you
üéØ **Context-Aware** - Works in your projects with full codebase context, or standalone
üì¶ **Auto-Validation** - Validates skill structure and packaging automatically
üîß **Script Generation** - Creates helper scripts, references, and assets as needed
üìù **Smart Customization** - Claude writes skill content based on your requirements
üöÄ **Multiple Patterns** - Use as marketplace, project tool, or sandbox

## Quick Start

Choose the pattern that fits your needs:

### For Creating Project-Specific Skills (Recommended ‚≠ê)

Perfect when you want Claude to have full context of YOUR codebase:

```bash
# Copy the command to your project
mkdir -p .claude/commands
curl -o .claude/commands/create-skill.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/claude-code-skill-creator/main/.claude/commands/create-skill.md

# In Claude Code:
/create-skill
```

### For Creating Shareable General-Purpose Skills

Perfect for building a library of reusable skills:

```bash
# In Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/claude-code-skill-creator
/plugin install skill-creator-tool@claude-code-skill-creator

# Then create skills:
/create-skill
```

### For Learning and Experimentation

Perfect for exploring and prototyping:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/claude-code-skill-creator.git
cd claude-code-skill-creator

# In Claude Code:
/create-skill
```

[Full Setup Instructions for Pattern C ‚Üí](PATTERNS.md#pattern-c-sandboxlearning)

## Why Use This Tool?

### Before: Manual Skill Creation
```bash
mkdir my-skill
cd my-skill
# Create SKILL.md with proper YAML frontmatter
# Write all instructions manually
# Create scripts/, references/, assets/ if needed
# Validate frontmatter format
# Package as .zip
# Register in marketplace.json
```

### After: Automated with `/create-skill`
```bash
/create-skill
> I want a skill for analyzing JSON files
# Claude creates everything automatically
‚úÖ Skill created, validated, and packaged!
```

## What Gets Created?

When you run `/create-skill`, you'll get:

üìÑ **SKILL.md** - Complete skill file with:
- Proper YAML frontmatter
- Custom instructions based on your requirements
- Examples and guidelines
- Resource documentation

üîß **Helper Scripts** (optional) - Python/Bash scripts for automation

üìö **Reference Documentation** (optional) - Detailed guides and API docs

üé® **Asset Files** (optional) - Templates, boilerplate, or resources

üì¶ **Packaged .zip** - Ready to share or distribute

‚úÖ **Validation** - Automatically checks skill structure

## Usage Patterns

This tool supports three different usage patterns. **Choose the one that fits your needs:**

### Pattern A: Global Marketplace
Create and share general-purpose skills through a centralized marketplace.

**Best for:** JSON parsers, Git helpers, documentation templates, code formatters

[Learn More ‚Üí](PATTERNS.md#pattern-a-global-marketplace)

### Pattern B: Local Project Tool ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
Create project-specific skills with full codebase context.

**Best for:** "Analyze our database schema", "Generate our API docs", "Write tests for our endpoints"

**Why powerful:** Claude sees your entire project when creating the skill, so it can reference YOUR specific code, APIs, and patterns.

[Learn More ‚Üí](PATTERNS.md#pattern-b-local-project-tool)

### Pattern C: Sandbox/Learning
Clone and experiment in a safe environment.

**Best for:** Learning how skills work, prototyping ideas, exploring examples

## Example Skills You Can Create

üí° **Simple instruction-only skills:**
- Code review best practices
- Documentation style guide
- Git workflow helper

üîß **Script-heavy skills:**
- Image processing (resize, convert, compress)
- Database migration generator
- Log file analyzer

üìã **Template-based skills:**
- API documentation generator
- Project scaffolding
- README templates

üéØ **Project-specific skills:**
- "Test writer for our FastAPI app"
- "Migration script generator for our DB schema"
- "Documentation following our standards"

## How It Works

1. **You run** `/create-skill`
2. **Claude asks** what you want to create
3. **Claude generates**:
   - Skill name (or you provide one)
   - Complete SKILL.md file
   - Helper scripts if needed
   - Reference documentation if needed
   - Asset files if needed
4. **Claude validates** the skill structure
5. **Claude packages** as a .zip file
6. **Optionally registers** in marketplace.json
7. **You're done!** ‚úÖ
